# SmartCar C++ Coding Style Guideline

## Author: Peter Tse (mcreng)

This guideline is written in reference to *C++ Coding Standards and Style Guide* by NASA in 2005.

### Introduction

This guideline is aimed to provide a recommendation in C++ code writing which is

* Organized
* Easy to read
* Easy to understand
* Maintainable
* Extendable
* Efficient

### Names

In general, choose names that are meaningful and readable.

* If abbreviations can be used. do so. The abbreviations should be all in the same case.

  ```C++
  class PIDController;
  BTComm btComm;
  ```

* Avoid underscores

#### Struct/Class Names

* Capitalize the first letter of each word.

  ```C++
  class FeatureExtraction;
  struct Edge;
  ```

#### Method/Function Names

* Capitalize the first letter of each word. The function name should start with a verb if possible.

  ```C++
  FindOneLeftEdge();
  ```

  Some examples of prefix verbs.

  | Verbs             | Meaning                                  |
  | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
  | Is/Has/Can        | Asking questions about something and return bool type |
  | Set               | Setters                                  |
  | Get               | Getters                                  |
  | Init              | Inititialization                         |
  | Calc/Find/Compute | Computation                              |

* The name of the class should not be duplicated in a method name.

  ```C++
  Edge Push(); // not Edge PushEdge();
  ```

#### Namespace Names

* Each subpart of your project should be contained in one namespace, with the first letter of each word capitalized.

  ```C++
  namespace Algorithm;
  namespace Utility;
  namespace ControlSys;
  ```

#### Variable Names

*  Variables should be in camelCase, i.e. the first letter of the each word capitalized except the first.

  ```C++
  Edge leftEdge;
  ```

* Variable names should be concise at its purpose. If it is not possible, add a comment along with it.

##### Method/Function Parameters

* Parameter names can have the same name as its type, but with the first letter not capitalized,

  ```C++
  void genPath(Feature feature);
  ```

* The parameter name can also be the initial of its type.

  ```C++
  void genPath(Featuer f);
  ```

##### Pointers

* Names of pointers should start with `p`.

* Place the `*` operator with the name instead of type.

  ```C++
  Motor *pMotor = &motor;
  ```

##### Reference

* Place the `&` operator with the name instead of type.

  ```C++
  Coord findFirstCorner(const Edge &edge);
  ```

* For operator overloads, put the `&` with the type.

  ```C++
  Coord& operator+=(const Coord& coord);
  ```

#### Type Names

* Type name should have the first letter of each word capitalized.

  ```C++
  typedef uint16_t Byte;
  ```

#### Enum Struct Names

* The `enum struct` name should follow the one in *Class Name*.

* The members of the `enum struct` should start with `k` and follow its name with first letter of each word capitalized.

  ```C++
  enum struct Feature {
    kStraight = 0,
    kRoundroad,
    kCrossroad
  };
  ```

* If the `enum struct` is used with the purpose of flag, name it with the word 'Type'.

  ```C++
  enum struct RoundaboutStatusType {
    kDetectedEntry = 0,
    kInside,
    kDetectedExit,
    kOutside
  };
  ```

  The variable with that type then should have the name camelCase without the word 'Type'.

  ```C++
  RoundaboutStatusType roundaboutStatus = RoudaboutStatusType::kOutside;
  ```

#### Constant Names

* Constant names should be in all CAPS with underscores between words.

  ```C++
  const uint16_t MAX_NUMBER_OF_EDGE_ENTRY = 200;
  ```

#### C++ File Names

* All header files should end with `.h` type.
* All source files should end with `.cpp` type.
* File names of both header and source should match and are put in `\inc` and `\src` folders respectively.

### Variables and Constants

* Declarations of temporary variables should just be above the scope it is used.

  ```C++
  uint16_t blackCount = 0;
  for (uint16_t i = 0; i < leftEdge.size(); i++)
    blackCount += leftEdge.at(i)
  ```

* Beware of the placement of variables, prevent frequent construction and destruction for temporary variables.

* Avoid the use of global variables, rather provide them through the use of class API/namespace.

* Always provide an initialized value for variables.

  * Use `nullptr` instead of `NULL` for initialization of pointers.

* Avoid `#define`, use `const` instead.

* If constant references can be used instead of pointers, use them.

### Formatting

#### Variables

* It is preferable to declare variables with similar purpose in the same line, one per line if not applicable.

  ```C++
  Edge leftEdge, rightEdge;
  ```

#### Indentation

* Use 4 spaces instead of a tab for indentation since indentation maybe different for different editors and environments,

#### Space

* Put one space after a comma/semicolon.

  ```C++
  pow(2, 3);
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++);
  ```

* Put one space around `=`.

  ```C++
  c1 = c2;
  ```

* Put space between keyword and parentheses.

  ```C++
  if ( ... );
  while ( ... );
  ```

* Put space between parentheses and braces.

  ```C++
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    ...
  }
  ```

* No space between function name parentheses.

  ```C++
  x = pow(2, 3);
  ```

* No space between unary/primary operators and the operands.

  ```C++
  p->m;
  s.m;
  a[i];
  a(i);
  ++i;
  -n;
  *p;
  &r;
  ```

#### Blank Lines

* Use blank lines to separate different sections of your code to make it more understandable.

#### Method/Function Arguments

* If the arguments are too long to be put in one single line, you may line the arguments up with the first argument.

  ```C++
  Clamp(servoBounds.kLeft,
        pidController.Calc(error),
        servoBounds.kRight)
  ```

#### Scopes

* Indent statements if they are in a scope.

  ```C++
  while (condition) {
    statement;
  }
  ```

#### Control/Loop

* Same rule with *Scopes*.

* If the inner statement contains only one line, you may write the whole control in one line, or two line with indentation (without braces).

  ```C++
  if (condition) statement;
  //OR
  if (condition)
    statement;
  ```

* It is recommended to use explicit comparisons.

  ```C++
  if (leftEdge.size() != 0);
  //instead of
  if (leftEdge.size());
  ```

### Conditional Statements

- Put space around conditional operators.

  ```c++
  x = (a > b) ? a : b;
  ```

- Align the `?` and `:` operators in new lines if the statement is too long to be put in one line.

  ```C++
  (condition)
    ? statement1
    : statement2;
  ```

#### Switch

* Always have `default` case, which is put after all other cases and should have `break;` as well for consistency. If it should not be triggered, write a comment to specify it.

* If certain cases are meant to not have `break;`, specify them with a comment.

* You may have a scope declared inside certain case.

  ```C++
  switch (expression) {
    case a:
      statement;
      break;
    case b: // fall through
      statement;
    case c:
      {
        statement;
        break;
      }
    default:
      // not handled
      break;
  }
  ```

### Statements

* Prevent the use of `goto`. Only use it if you believe the control loop would look better with `goto` instead of use of flags.

* You may use ` ? : ` if you believe the statements involved are not too complex.

* Use `constexpr` if you wish the compiler resolve the expression before compilation.

  ```C++
  constexpr const float SERVO_MODEL_CONST = 120 / 0.5 + 0.6 * std::sin(0.2);
  ```

### Functions

* Use `inline` keyword if the functions are very short.

  ```C++
  template <class T>
  inline T max(T a, T b) { return (a > b) ? a : b; }
  ```

* Use boolean functions if applicable.

  ```C++
  bool FindOneLeftEdge(){
    // find one left edge, return false if failed
    return true;
  }
  ```

### Documentations

* Always write documentations for class interface (declaration) and function prototypes.

  ```C++
  /**
   * PIDController Class
   *
   * <brief description>
   */
  class PIDController{
  public:
    /**
     * @brief Constructor
     * @param kP P constant
     * @param kI I constant
     * @param kD D constant
     */
    PIDController(float kP, float kD, float kD) { ... }
    
    /**
     * @brief Next control value getter
     * @return Control value
     */
    float getNextVal() { return ...; }
  }
  ```

* Always write the meaning of each constants, specify the unit if necessary.

  ```C++
  const uint16_t MAX_DISTANCE 400; // Max distance the sensor can detect, in km
  ```

### Classes

* Class declaration should be purely prototypes and attribute declarations.

  * Any implementations should be put outside the class declaration
  * Use `inline` if appropriate

* Sections of `public`, `protected` and `private` should be declared in said order.

* Inherited class should have the name of the base class as part of its name.

  ```C++
  class AlternateMotor : public Motor;
  ```

* Abstract class should have the function-to-be-overridden declared as pure virtual function, and the inherited class should override the function with `override` keyword.

  ```C++
  class Motor {
  private:
    virtual void OnSetPower(uint16_t power) = 0;
  };

  class AlternateMotor : public Motor {
  private:
    void OnSetPower(uint16_t power) override;
  };
  ```

### Templates

* Generic type should have name `T`, `U`, `V`, etc.

* For safety concern, you can include library `<type_traits>` to make sure only certain types are usable.

  ```C++
  #includfe <type_traits>

  template <class T, class = typename std::enable_if<std::is_arithmetic<T>::value>::type>
  ...
  ```


### Files

#### Headers

* Preprocessor directive (`#ifndef - #define - #endif`) should be used in every header.

#### Includes

* Included libraries should be arranged from top to bottom, low-level to high-level.

* Included C++ libraries should be put around `<>` brackets.

* Do not include C libraries, include their C++ counterparts.

* Included libsccc/self-made libraries should be put around `" "`.

  ```C++
  #include <cmath> // not "math.h"
  #include <string>

  #include "libsc/motor.h" // libsccc

  #include "BTComm.h" // self-made
  ```
