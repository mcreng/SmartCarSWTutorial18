 Append { Path of GNU Tools for ARM folder }\bin to [PATH] Variable
 Append { Path of GNU Make folder }\bin to [PATH] Variable
 [Apply]
 You can try to build the library

### 4. Project Setting

whenever you want to create a new project for programming smart car, you can start from this section. It is always a good measure to have a spare project for testing.

#### 4.1Create New Project

Right-click on [Project Explorer] -> [New] -> [C++ Project]
 Project Type: [Executable : Empty Project], Toolchains: [Cross GCC]

#### 4.2 Property Setting

repeat 3.4

Goto [C/C++ Build : Environment]
 [Add...] -> Name: “LIBSCCC_BIN_PATH” -> Value: { Path of library folder }\lib
 [Add...] -> Name: “LIBSCCC_INC_PATH” -> Value: { Path of library folder }\inc
 [Apply]

**Remember that variable [SCCC_CONFIG] of both library and your own project must be the same.**

#### 4.3 Include the Library to your Project

Goto [C/C++ General : Paths and Sybmols]
 Goto [Includes] tab
 Select Languages: [GNU C++]
