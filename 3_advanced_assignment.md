# C++ Programming - Advanced - Assignment

## Author: Peter Tse (mcreng)

### Introduction

In SmartCar image processing, you probably need to store the coordinates of certain points in the image. Here you are going to develop a coordinate class for it. There is **NO** provided header.

### Requirements

* Includes the $x$ and $y$ coordinates with generic type
* Implements the $x$, $y$ and coordinate setters & getters
* Overload the following operators
  * `a+b`
  * `a-b`
  * `a+=b`
  * `a-=b`
  * `std::cout << a` (or technically `std::ostream << a`)
* Implement the following arithmetic functions
  * prefix `++x`
  * prefix `++y`
  * prefix `--x`
  * prefix `--y`
  * postfix `x++`
  * postfix `y++`
  * postfix `x--`
  * postfix `y--`
* Implement the following mathematical functions
  * Distance ($d = \sqrt{\Delta x^2 + \Delta y^2}$)
  * Manhattan Distance ($d = |\Delta x| + |\Delta y|$)
  * Slope ($ m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$)
  * Triangle Area enclosed by three points $A, B, C$ ($a = |\frac{A_x (B_y - C_y) + B_x (C_y - A_y) + C_x (A_y - B_y)}{2}|$)
  * Radius of Circle generated by three points $A, B, C$ ($\frac{AB \cdot BC \cdot CA}{4[ABC]}$, where $[ABC]$ is the triangle area of $ABC$)
* Bonus
  * Figure(Find) a less resource-intensive (in return of less accuracy) implementation of square root and use it in calculating distance.

*Google is your friend when it comes to problems that you encounter in C++ programming.*

### Submission

In this assignment, three aspects will be examined.

* Correctness

  The correctness of your implementations.

* Readability

  The readability of your codes, including the presence of documentations.

* Coding Practice

  The coding style that you have, including OOP practices.

Try your best in achieving fully in all three aspects. Deadline of this assignment would be ????/??/??.
