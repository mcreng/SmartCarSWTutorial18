### 1. What is Git

Basic concept: Google drive for coders

Login to your account

​    

​    

Upload and download 

​    

Git push and git pull 

​    

​    

Where to upload

​    

Git set-upstream origin ...... Git

​    

​    

What to upload and download

​    

A code commit, which is just version of code, and you need to describe what is changed in one sentence

​    

Git commit -m "your Message "

​    

​    

Decide what to keep track of

​    

git stage, git add

​    

​    

​    

Branch and merge

​    

When there is diverge version/ new feature/ different  people working, better use branch to avoid conflict/ as a restart point （aka 砍掉重煉不太痛）

​    

Master branch: Most likely the default main branch 

​    

​    

Open new branch 

​    

Git checkout -b branch-name

​    

​    

Goto existing branch

​    

Git checkout branch-name

​    

​    

Merge branch

​    

The version or feature converge

​    

Git checkout base-branch 

​    

Git merge source-branch 

​    

​    

If you are merging branch A to master and there is possible conflict, it is better to solve the conflict at A first, to make sure the new code is compatible with current code in master
